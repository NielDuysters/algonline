# NodeJS webserver

The web-panel is made in NodeJS. It does not contain logic to manipulate data or algorithms. It only handles the requests made by the user and acts as intermediary between the client and the Rust-server.

After the user is logged in, NodeJS can authenticate the requests to the Rust-server by adding the session-token of the user in the header or as parameter.
